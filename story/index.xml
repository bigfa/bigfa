The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/story/changlog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:22:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/story/changlog/</guid><description>Hello World!</description></item></channel></rss>
