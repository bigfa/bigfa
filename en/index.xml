I am writing an article to wrap up my experiences, all of which are based on my actual usage.
Basic Situation First of all, the selection of equipment is a very important part of the enjoyment of photography. You may quickly lose interest after the purchase, but it&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the selection process is extremely joyful.</description></item><item><title>Observations on the road to Bali.</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/bali/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 11:22:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/bali/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know when traveling started to become all about checking in at locations and taking photos for social media. Reflecting back, I never thought about checking in anywhere when I traveled in the past, nor was there such a thing as looking for designated photo spots. It was just the excitement of visiting a place. Taking photos was simply a way to document the journey, not to travel for the sake of photography.</description></item><item><title>Friends</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/friends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/friends/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Who am I</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/about/</guid><description>Most bloggers have a simple introduction page, which is usually called “关于” in Chinese or “about” in English. To be honest, I don’t really like this word as it gives a dull impression. Moreover, since I started blogging, I haven’t really introduced myself, at most just mentioning my contact information. On social networks, most people only showcase their best side and even exaggerate their qualities. Many people are also reluctant to reveal too much about themselves online, and I belong to that category.</description></item><item><title>书影音游</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/movies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/movies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>搜索</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 23:22:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/search/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fujifilm X-S20 first review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/fuji-xs20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:57:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/fuji-xs20/</guid><description>One of my goals set in the New Year&amp;rsquo;s blog was to buy a Leica camera; at that time, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many choices available, only the Q2. This year the Q3 was released, priced at fifty thousand, and the Q2 didn&amp;rsquo;t see much of a price drop, with gray market new units still costing over thirty thousand. Previously, seeing that two-thirds of the year had already passed and that thirty thousand yuan was beyond my spending capability, my teammate happened to be interested in trying out a zoom lens, which shifted our attention to Fujifilm.</description></item><item><title>Garden Pavilion</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/garden-pavilion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 21:48:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/garden-pavilion/</guid><description>Garden Pavilion Over the weekend, I had a meal at Garden Pavilion, located at the Park Hyatt hotel. Prior to this visit, I was hesitant due to the high average cost per person mentioned on Dianping, ranging from seven to eight hundred yuan. However, since we were staying at the hotel, we decided to give it a try. In all honesty, the overall experience was underwhelming. The atmosphere was pleasant, but the dishes were quite mediocre, and the prices were steep.</description></item><item><title>Fox Umbrellas</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/fox-umbrellas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:00:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/fox-umbrellas/</guid><description>Recently, I purchased two British-style umbrellas, and I am really fond of them. Let me share a bit about them. One has a Malacca handle, and the other has a bamboo handle.
Fox Umbrellas Ltd was founded in 1868 and has been producing the worlds finest umbrellas for over 150 years.</description></item><item><title>Park Hyatt ShenZhen</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/park-hyatt-shenzhen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 19:07:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/park-hyatt-shenzhen/</guid><description>Park Hyatt ShenZhen Since successfully completing the Globalist challenge, I have gradually started experiencing Hyatt hotels. In Shenzhen, I only wanted to experience Andaz and Park Hyatt. Last Saturday, I stayed at Park Hyatt Shenzhen. I opted for a cash stay this time, and the price of 2100 RMB on a Saturday was considered reasonable, considering that hotel prices in Shenzhen tend to be higher on weekends.
Park Hyatt ShenZhen Park Hyatt Shenzhen is located in the Annex Tower of Ping An Financial Center.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF23mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:46:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf23/</guid><description>35 equivalent lenses, they are just never wide enough or never tight enough, like story of my life.
XF23mm F1.4 R LM WR Now whenever I use a 35mm lens, I have this image in my mind, with a strange sense of sadness.
Years ago, when I was using Olympus, I bought a prime lens that was roughly equivalent to 35mm. I didn’t choose this focal length because I particularly liked it, but simply because it was affordable.</description></item><item><title>Leica Sofort</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/sofort/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:32:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/sofort/</guid><description>Leica Sofort The first instant camera I owned was the Fuji Mini 40. I used it for about a year and a half and took around 400 pictures with it. Because I wanted to try double exposure, I decided to upgrade to the Mini 90. However, I found out that its price has risen to 1500 dollars. Coincidentally, Leica recently released the Sofort 2, which reminded me of the Sofort 1 that I couldn’t afford years ago.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF33mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf33/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:55:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf33/</guid><description>XF33mmF1.4 R LM WR The XF33mmF1.4 lens is currently one of the most difficult lenses to buy in mainland China. It is basically out of stock everywhere online, and even pre-orders come with a price markup.
I originally planned to publish this article at least during the Singles’ Day shopping festival, but unexpectedly, it was published much earlier. The main reason is that this lens is simply unavailable, and it’s impossible to buy, even with pre-orders requiring a price markup.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF56mm F1.2 R WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf56/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:59:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf56/</guid><description>Fujinon XF56ｍｍF1.2 R WR Recently, I bought a lens mainly because the low-light performance of my X100V was poor. When I pick up the camera at night and want to quickly take a photo, it’s highly likely to come out blurry or have a lot of noise if I increase the ISO. When I didn’t know much about Fujifilm lenses, my first choice was the XF50F1.0 because of its large aperture.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF18mm F1.4 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:34:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf18/</guid><description>富士 XF18mmF1.4 R LM WR Actually, I received this lens before the XF56 Mark II, but I didn’t use it much and didn’t take many sample photos. I always felt that this lens had greater potential, so I took it out last weekend and took some shots. However, I realized that it was just the same as before, and I ended up with only a few photos for this article.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF 90mm f/2 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:22:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</guid><description>XF90mmF2 R LM WR Fuji has a relatively niche lens, and it’s also quite old. The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough.</description></item><item><title>Gears</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/gears/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 15:39:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/gears/</guid><description>my gear</description></item></channel></rss>
