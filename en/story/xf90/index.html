The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough. At that time, I seriously considered the XF 50-140. Although it has received almost 100% positive reviews, I eventually decided against it due to its high price and weight. The main reason behind this decision was certainly the price, as it was simply too expensive.</p><p>This lens weighs just over a pound, which is within an acceptable range for me. Even when shooting handheld, the success rate is quite high with this weight. Perhaps due to its focal length, the lens hood is also made relatively large. After attaching the lens hood, it becomes very long and appears overly aggressive, so I rarely bring it along when I go out. This does increase the risk of the lens getting bumped or scratched, especially when traveling.</p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/j252nfoibrb2d4e5.jpg alt></p><p>The lens is equipped with a Quad Linear Motor, which is claimed to have the fastest autofocus. However, in practical use, it can still be challenging to capture the movements of a fast-moving cat. It becomes even more difficult in low-light conditions. I usually set the ISO to a maximum of 1600, but even compared to the XF 56mm f/1.2, it’s still quite frustrating to capture images in low-light environments.</p><p>It seems like the XF 90mm lens doesn’t have much popularity in the domestic market compared to the XF 56mm f/1.2. Its 135mm equivalent focal length doesn’t offer much room for indoor shooting. However, it appears to be well-liked by foreign photographers. Before the release of the Fujifilm’s second-generation 1.4 lenses, the XF 90mm was considered the sharpest lens in their lineup. Even now, when paired with the fifth-generation sensor, it performs exceptionally well with the aperture wide open.</p><p>One of the things I like about the XF 90mm lens is that it has a filter thread size of 62mm, allowing me to use the same filter system as my XF 18mm lens. This means that I can use my ND filters with this lens as well. It’s great for shooting videos outdoors during the day with the aperture wide open. Using smaller-sized UV filters also reduces the cost. Filters above 70mm from reputable brands can be quite expensive.</p><h2>Pros</h2><ul><li>Good control over size and weight for a 135mm equivalent lens.</li><li>Excellent image quality.</li><li>Comfortable focusing and aperture rings with good damping.</li><li>Fast autofocus.</li><li>f/2 aperture, combined with in-body image stabilization, allows for shooting in low light conditions.</li><li>The 62mm filter size reduces cost.</li></ul><h2>Cons</h2><ul><li>With the lens hood attached, it becomes a bit long and has an aggressive appearance.</li><li>There is a certain probability of misfocusing when initially starting up.</li><li>As a first-generation lens, it is considered expensive.</li></ul><h2>Sample photos</h2><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/efyoke4knb0qqq3y.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/80aa5p6y788exakf.jpg alt></p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/hf0d624p9oyo1xnp.jpg alt="XF90mmF2 R LM WR"><figcaption class=imageCaption>XF90mmF2 R LM WR</figcaption></figure></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/vorbi3yn1l5ywrjc.jpg alt></p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/v84fl0iu5yfr3r7x.jpg alt="M Stand"><figcaption class=imageCaption>M Stand</figcaption></figure></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/efyoke4knb0qqq3y.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/atoen5o5e3tpb54c.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/genhpyns2jny9ave.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/jedgo9hc8g4xapr8.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/5gytvd8igzcnulve.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/0c4oeylzdrx444ru.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/gznitja9yzohso03.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/vgo5trbpdb95e70p.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/z6bkeagoh43675j8.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/47jz6py05lzimfry.jpg alt></p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/10/f8ao5f54nb6jz7be.jpg alt></p><h2>in summary</h2><p>I am highly satisfied with this medium telephoto lens which I find suitable for everyday use. It offers good control over size and weight, excellent image quality, comfortable handling with smooth focus and aperture rings, and fast autofocus. The f/2 aperture, along with camera&rsquo;s in-body image stabilization, allows for low light shooting. Additionally, the 62mm filter size reduces costs. However, it has some drawbacks, including a longer length with the lens hood attached and occasional misfocusing at startup. Despite being an older lens, I believe that any updates may result in increased size and weight, making it less ideal for regular use. Overall, I am pleased with this lens.</p></div><div class="article--tags u-paddingTop20"><a href=/en/tags/fujifilm/ class=artile--tag><span>#</span>fujifilm</a></div><div class=postCat--item><img src=https://static.fatesinger.com/2021/12/vhp6eou5x2wqh2zy.jpg class=cover><div class=postCat--content><a href=/en/categories/gears/ class=artile--category>Gears</a><p>fujifilm cameras and lenses</p></div></div></div></main><footer class=site--footer><div class=layoutSingleColumn><div class=copyright>Theme by <a href=https://fatesinger.com/74850 target=_blank>bigfa</a>
