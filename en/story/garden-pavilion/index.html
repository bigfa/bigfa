Prior to this visit, I was hesitant due to the high average cost per person mentioned on Dianping, ranging from seven to eight hundred yuan. However, since we were staying at the hotel, we decided to give it a try. In all honesty, the overall experience was underwhelming. The atmosphere was pleasant, but the dishes were quite mediocre, and the prices were steep. I would say it was not worth the expense.</p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/1g0qa9yff44npf7u.jpg alt></p><p>In Shenzhen, the Park Hyatt hotel features an impressive atrium with the restaurant Garden Pavilion located on the same floor. It is easily accessible via an elevator that goes directly to the lobby. If you want to go to the guest rooms, you would need to transfer to another elevator. This restaurant has a unique and distinctive ambiance, as it is situated within the building and even features trees growing inside.
<img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/klt01o49s30vcg9b.jpg alt></p><p>I recall that it is usually quite difficult to secure a reservation at this restaurant on weekends. Therefore, I made a reservation in advance for this visit. However, to my surprise, there were not many people when we arrived at our reserved dining time. It appears that the quality of the food has significantly declined, leading to a loss of customers.</p><p><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/fh1gcvs71nmylgob.jpg alt></p><p>As for the ambiance, it was just average. In Shenzhen, you can experience a similar environment at half the price, and the quality of the food is not lacking either. Personally, I do not recommend Garden Pavilion. This was my first time dining at a restaurant in this price range, and I must say that the quality of the dishes was disappointing. Each dish was served with separate chopsticks, and the service was well-maintained, but the overall quality of the food was truly unsatisfactory.</p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/z18ld9ej1qmtci01.jpeg alt="The appetizers"><figcaption class=imageCaption>The appetizers</figcaption></figure></p><p>The appetizers were not tasty, and I would say they were not even as good as what you would find at a restaurant that serves complimentary fruit.</p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/cvvamkgar7dnvnbj.jpeg alt="Crispy Iberian Char Siu"><figcaption class=imageCaption>Crispy Iberian Char Siu</figcaption></figure></p><p>The BBQ pork was also mediocre, I think even the black gold BBQ pork from Jingego Restaurant, which costs only a few tens of yuan, is better than this.</p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/rufa4cx77a6wb1bj.jpeg alt="Lotus Roots Stuffed with Osmanthus Honey"><figcaption class=imageCaption>Lotus Roots Stuffed with Osmanthus Honey</figcaption></figure></p><p>Teammate may enjoy it, but personally, I don’t have any particular preference for it.</p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/2csvemxe1o7x8zy1.jpeg alt="Mapo Beef Tofu with Beef Tendons"><figcaption class=imageCaption>Mapo Beef Tofu with Beef Tendons</figcaption></figure></p><p>As a tofu enthusiast, I actually think this dish is decent. However, I have some complaints about the container used. The service is already slow, and when the Mapo Tofu gets cold, it can become a bit fishy. It would be better if they used a stone pot to keep it warm.</p><p><figure class=grap--figure><img src=//static.fatesinger.com/2023/11/muqowxn1g10971sp.jpeg alt="The Ice-burned Three-layer Pork"><figcaption class=imageCaption>The Ice-burned Three-layer Pork</figcaption></figure></p><p>The Ice-burned Three-layer Pork is really not up to par.

Now, Rong Ge is no longer on the Black Pearl list, which is reasonable considering their declining food quality while maintaining high prices. I cannot recommend it, especially considering the price of 1150¥ for a meal for two people (excluding drinks).</p></div><div class=tag--list><a href=/en/tags/hyatt/ class=artile--tag>hyatt</a></div></article></main><footer class=site--footer><div class=site--footer__content>Made with 💗<div class=copyright>© Copyright
