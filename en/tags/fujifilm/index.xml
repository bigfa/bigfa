It is basically out of stock everywhere online, and even pre-orders come with a price markup.
I originally planned to publish this article at least during the Singles’ Day shopping festival, but unexpectedly, it was published much earlier. The main reason is that this lens is simply unavailable, and it’s impossible to buy, even with pre-orders requiring a price markup.</description></item></channel></rss>
