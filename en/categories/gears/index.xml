I always felt that this lens had greater potential, so I took it out last weekend and took some shots. However, I realized that it was just the same as before, and I ended up with only a few photos for this article.</description></item><item><title>Fujinon XF 90mm f/2 R LM WR Review</title><link>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:22:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bigfa.github.io/en/story/xf90/</guid><description>XF90mmF2 R LM WR Fuji has a relatively niche lens, and it’s also quite old. The second-hand price is around 4000, but usually, it has been used for a long time. The original price is too expensive, so I ended up finding a refurbished one through official channels. It has a minor defect with a small dust particle, but it’s tolerable. When I purchased the XF 56, I mentioned that the focal length was not quite enough.</description></item></channel></rss>
